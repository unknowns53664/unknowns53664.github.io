                <p>   Just recently, on October 22, 2022, I revisited my barber shop. I've been going to the same barber shop for at least 2 years now, and I’ve been revisiting the same person for even longer than that. How much longer, I can’t recall. The barber shop is very close to Main Street in Flushing, a relatively large town in Queens. Although, I guess I don’t really have much of a frame of reference for “large.” Relatively abstract words like “large” can be interpreted many different ways, by many different people. Some people might think that “large” could be a few blocks, depending on how much they walk around. Other people define large as a whole city, but this is beside the point. People are prone to changing their minds, regardless. Specifically, New Yorkers tend to change their mind, or change as people. This tends to be shown through physical changes. To explain this further, the explanation must be preceded by a moment in time: my first time visiting the barber shop.</p>
                <p>   The first time my family and I visited the barber shop in question, I was told ahead of time that there was a location change. The first location of the haircutter that we often visited was somewhere around Main Street, on the street across from that vibrant Rainbow store I’ve never seen. But now, it’s on an adjacent street to Main Street, very close to one of the entrances to the subway station. Until very recently, I paid no mind to my surroundings, but eventually, I realized that I pass by that exact barber shop essentially every day on my walk to the station. That realization may have given me a glimpse as to what being a true New Yorker is like. For a majority of my life, I didn’t take the subway consistently, or visit any nearby shops. There was simply no need, as I always just wanted to go home as soon as possible. But during 10th grade, I had found myself needing to commute everyday, which was a foreign experience to me. Even so, I didn’t view many stores nearby, as going home was a priority. But as time passed, I accumulated more experiences, learned more about the area around me, and eventually familiarized myself with my surroundings. Subtleties that a non-New Yorker would never pay attention to, I found myself beginning to take notice of. I began appreciating those that would apologize even for borderline unnoticeable acts on the train. Perhaps it’s just me overthinking things, but I did find it wholesome when strangers would be genuinely apologetic towards me or anyone else. Appreciation is always originally derived from acts of kindness or generosity, and I feel as though we should take more notice of small things. I believe that, the more someone seems apologetic towards small things, the better person they are, or at least the more attentive they are. Things like holding an elevator door for someone who appears to be in a rush, moving over for someone else to take a seat on the subway, these things are worth at least a nod of recognition. But people should also give recognition to people who do the things that others aren’t willing to do. Janitors, retail workers, and barbers are willing to tolerate surprisingly frustrating jobs.</p>
                <p>   Regardless of whether you've actually put yourself in such shoes, many people can likely empathize with those with tedious jobs, even if they seem very simple on the surfa.ce. Janitors have to clean up the aftermath of almost anything, retail workers and other types of minimum wage jobs typically make people put up with the nonsense of others, and barbers have to deal with messy, unkept, downright revolting hair. These people typically have some sort of resentment towards their jobs, and justifiably so. As such, people should take this into consideration a bit, and think a bit deeper about what others are going through. Even a small sentiment goes a long way. </p>
